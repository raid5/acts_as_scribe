Resources
=========

Install (Rails 3)
-------
 
 * Add the following line to your Gemfile:
 
 `gem 'acts_as_scribe', :git => 'git://github.com/raid5/acts_as_scribe.git', :branch => 'rails3'`
 
 * Generate the tables via the given generator:

 `rails g acts_as_scribe_migration`
 
 * And finally...
 
 `rake db:migrate`
 
Record activities in your models
---------------------------------------------

Associate the scribe activities with your user model:
<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base    
  has_many :scribe_activities
end
</pre>
<pre>
  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base    
    record_activity_of :user
  end
</pre>
You can use any association that is related to an user:
<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author
  end
</pre>

This will register automatically a new activity when you create or destroy a new record. If you want control over the activities registration based on your model's state just use the :if option

<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author, :if => Proc.new { |post| post.private == false }
  end
</pre>

If you record activities different than the default create and destroy you can specify the :actions option

<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author, :actions => [:create, :update, :destroy]
  end
</pre>


Record activities without related item
--------------------------------------

If you want to record activities not related to any specific model just use `Activity.report` in your code:
<pre>
  def grant_admin(user)
    user.admin = true
    Activity.report(current_user, :grant_admin, user)
  end
</pre>
If the action is not related to any item, just don't use it.
<pre>
  def login
    current_user = User.find(â€¦)
    Activity.report(current_user, :login)
  end
</pre>
