Description:
    The migration generator creates a migration to add the specified table to your database.

Example:
    rails generate acts_as_scribe_migration MODEL_NAME
	
	Migration:  db/migrate/{TIMESTAMP}_create_MODEL_NAME.rb
	The Activity model lives in the lib directory of this plugin. You can move that model into your models directory and modify it if you like.
